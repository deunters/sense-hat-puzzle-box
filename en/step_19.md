## Challenge: more locks

Beyond the locks described in this activity, there are many more you could create using the Sense HAT.

- Come up and write code for locks using other sensors on the Sense HAT or perhaps its joystick.
- You could adapt the combination lock by adding more steps to the combination.
- How would you add more potential angles to the combination lock, e.g. every 45 degrees rather than every 90?
- Why not build an actual physical box for your Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT?
