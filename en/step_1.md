## What you will make
In this activity you will create an electronic puzzle box to hide some secret information. Puzzle boxes have been used for centuries to hide secret items or information. Many people still make them today for their entertainment value.

For your electronic puzzle box you will use a Raspberry Pi and attached Sense HAT to get user input. The user will have to solve a series of puzzle steps in order to "open" the box.

## What you will learn
By building a Sense HAT puzzle box with your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

- Some of the historical techniques used to keep information secret
- How to collect real world data, using the Raspberry Pi and Sense HAT
- How to represent images, using Python lists and RGB values
- How to use loops, conditional statements and functions to create a series of "locks" to hide some information
