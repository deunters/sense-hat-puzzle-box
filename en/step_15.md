## What next?

- Beyond the locks demonstrated in this activity, there are many more you could create using the other sensors on the Sense HAT, perhaps using the joystick, humidity or magnetic sensors.
- Why not build an actual physical box for your Raspberry Pi and Sense Hat?

- You could adapt this lock by adding more steps to the combination.
- How would you add more potential angles, e.g. every 45 degrees rather than every 90?
