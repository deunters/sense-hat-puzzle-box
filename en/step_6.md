## Temperature lock

Using the Sense HAT's temperature sensors, this lock will require the user to raise or lower the temperature by a number of degrees in order to unlock.

### How will the lock work?

The lock will work as follows:

- Choose a target temperature close to the current temperature
- Display a colour clue as to whether the Sense HAT is too cold or too hot compared to the target temperature
- Continually check the current temperature against the target temperature
- When the target temperature is reached, display the unlocked graphic

The list above roughly describes the program you're going to write and is called an **algorithm** or a set of instructions.
