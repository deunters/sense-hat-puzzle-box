![](cover.png)

In this activity you will create an electronic puzzle box to hide some secret information. Puzzle boxes have been used for centuries to hide secret items or information. Many people still make them today for their entertainment value.

For your electronic puzzle box, you will use a Raspberry Pi and attached Sense HAT to get user input. The user will have to solve a series of puzzle steps in order to "open" the box.
